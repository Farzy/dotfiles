# Farzad FARID's collection of dot files

My own collection of dot files for often used programs.

## Installation

There is no installation script yet. Just copy the dotfiles in you home directory.

## TODO

 * Look at other dotfiles projects:
   * Ryan Bates' [dotfiles](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles)
   * Mathias Bynes' [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
   * Bruno Bonfils' [ZSH Configuration](http://svn.asyd.net/svn/zsh/trunk/)
   * tj_'s [vimrc](https://gist.github.com/961af9fd9cf7245d556e)

## Thanks to...

 * Cyril Mougel (Shingara) for his [Vim configuration](https://github.com/shingara/vim-conf)
